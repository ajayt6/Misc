These are mini utils and experimental works that I use for other projects. 

## 1) ScrapeOS

Scrape many pdf links in a particular web page in a particular ordering, download them and then merge all of them to a single PDF file.


## 2) google_results

Get the first link from google search programmatically on inputting a search term.
